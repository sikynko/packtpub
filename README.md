I send every day at 10:00:01 email, which download content from book from https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning and parse it and send it to email address title and description. The purpose is to know, which ebook is uploaded and if I will be interested I can open the page and download it.

In the feature I want to add criteria to send email only if cointains some keywoard and if yes I will automatically download ebook.
